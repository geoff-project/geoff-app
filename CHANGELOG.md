# Changelog

## Unreleased

No changes yet!

## v0.8.1

### build changes
- Add cern-sps-splitter-opt-env requirement to 0.0.8.

## v0.8.0

### Visible changes

- The `--machine` command-line parameter now also accepts machine names in
  lower-case.
- The new command-line parameter `--user` allows specifying the TGM user to
  preselect in the LSA selector. This allows forwarding a user selected in the
  CCM to this program.

### Build changes

- Upgrade cernml-coi requirement to 0.8.5. This enables use of AD and ELENA
  optimization problems.

## v0.7.5

### Visible changes

- BOBYQA now supports a higher precision on its `rhobeg` and `rhoend`
  parameters. For regrettable internal reasons, the input fields in the
  configuration dialog consequently no longer have spin controls.
- The runtime plugin mechanism (known as "foreign imports") now supports
  modules inside namespace packages. As before, it remains an error to import a
  namespace package directly. However, the error message in this case has been
  improved. (It used to be "AssertionError", now it reads "no `__init__.py`
  found".) This is to catch common mistakes in which a plugin's project
  directory is passed instead of the package path.

## v0.7.4

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.5.2.

## v0.7.3

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.5.1.

## v0.7.2

### Build changes

- Upgrade cernml-coi-utils to 0.2.5. This adds the ability to trim multiple
  functions at once via `cernml.lsa_utils.IncorporatorGroup`.
- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.5.0.

## v0.7.1

### Bug fixes

- FunctionOptimizable problems are now recognized as such again.

## v0.7.0

### Visible changes

- If a plugin raises an exception, open a message box instead of expanding the
  log console.
- Show an informational message box whenever an optimization, RL training, RL
  run or reset operation terminates successfully.

### Bug fixes

- The initial point for numerical optimization is now verified to be a 1-D
  float array. Returning anything else prevents optimization from starting.
  This catches a common bug where an array with `dtype="object"` is returned by
  accident.

## v0.6.0

### Visible changes

- Refactor logging. By default, the app now logs all events not only to the
  logging console, but also to a file in the user's temporary directory. This
  is to faciliate post-mortem debugging in the case of a crash. This behavior
  can be disabled with the new command-line option `--disable-logging`. The
  user may also choose a specific logging file with the new command-line option
  `--log-file`.
- Remove the command-line option `--no-capture-stdout`. It is made superfluous
  by the new setup. Its behavior can roughly be emulated with `--log-file=-`.
  This uses the new logging mechanism, but picks `stderr` instead of a real
  file for output.

## v0.5.0

### Visible changes

- Upgrade PyQtGraph from 0.10 to 0.12. This should bring a number of bug fixes,
  performance improvements and quality-of-life changes. In particular, curves
  on the **actor plot** can now be selectively hidden by clicking their
  respective **icon** in the graph's legend.
- Provide new screenshot button provided by
  [AccWidgets](https://acc-py.web.cern.ch/gitlab/acc-co/accsoft/gui/accsoft-gui-pyqt-widgets/docs/stable/widgets/screenshot/index.html).

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.4.4.
- Upgrade accwidgets requirement to 1.7.0.
- Upgrade pyqtgraph requirement to 0.12.0.
- Add dependency on pylogbook 3.3.0 for new screenshot button.

## v0.4.0

### Visible changes

- Add Extremum Seeking via
  [cernml-extremum-seeking](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/cernml-extremum-seeking/)
  as a numerical optimization scheme.

### Build changes

- Use [setuptools-scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/) for version
  management. This is a breaking change, as it removes the
  `acc_app_optimisation.__version__` constant. Please use
  [`importlib.metadata`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html)
  (backported as
  [`importlib_metadata`](https://importlib_metadata.readthedocs.io/) before
  Python 3.8) to query the app's version programmatically.

## v0.3.4

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.4.3.

## v0.3.3

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.4.2.

## v0.3.2

### Visible changes

- Resets of numerical optimization can now be cancelled. For most problems,
  this only does anything if the optimization problem is
  [cancellable](https://cernml-coi.docs.cern.ch/guide/cancellation.html#cancellation).
  For [function
  optimization](https://cernml-coi.docs.cern.ch/guide/funcopt.html), this may
  interrupt the reset between manipulated time points.
- If a plugin raises an exception, the log console expands automatically now.

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-awake-env requirement to 0.18.0.

## v0.3.1

### Bug fixes

- Fix broken configuration of Bayesian optimization.

## v0.3.0

### Visible changes

- Add Bayesian optimization via
  [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) as a numerical
  optimization scheme.

### Build changes

- Add dependency on scikit-optimize v0.9.0 for new Bayesian optimization.
- Drop dependency on cernml-coi-funcs v0.2.4. This package has been deprecated
  since [v0.0.1.8](#v018). The `FunctionOptimizable` interface has been
  integrated into cernml-coi; the LSA utilities have been integrated into
  cernml-coi-utils.

## v0.2.2

### Visible changes

- Before resets of numerical optimization, the user is shown the reset point
  and asked for confirmation.
- If an exception is raised during the import of foreign or built-in
  environments, an error dialog is shown to the user.

### Build changes

- Add linac3-lebit-tuning 1.0.0.

## v0.2.1

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.4.1.

## v0.2.0

### Build changes

- Upgrade cernml-coi requirement to 0.8.2. This is a breaking change w.r.t. to
  the previous 0.7.x line.
- Upgrade cern-awake-env requirement to 0.16.0.
- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.4.0.
- Upgrade cern-sps-tune-env requirement to 0.4.0.
- Upgrade cern-sps-zs-alignment-env requirement to 0.4.0.

### Visible changes

- Add a legend to the built-in actors plot.

## v0.1.11

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.3.2.

## v0.1.10

### Build changes

- Upgrade cernml-coi-utils to 0.2.3. This adds an optional *description*
  argument to LSA incorporations.
- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.3.1.

### Visible changes

- Expose option *nsamples* from BOBYQA, which allows you to evaluate the cost
  function multiple times and optimize on the average.

## v0.1.9

- Upgrade cern-sps-zs-alignment-env requirement to 0.3.2.
- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.3.0.

## v0.1.8

### Build changes

- Upgrade cernml-svd to 3.0.0. This reverts the way action normalization is
  done and finishes the initial prototype phase.
- Upgrade cernml-coi to 0.7.6. This is the last version that contains both
  interaces and utilities. Authors of optimization problems are encouraged to
  use
  [cernml-coi-utils](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/cernml-coi-utils/)
  for the latter. If their code works with cernml-coi 0.7.6 without deprecation
  warnings, it will likely work with the upcoming cernml-coi 0.8.0 as well.
- Upgrade cernml-coi-funcs to 0.2.4. This is the final release. The
  `FunctionOptimizable` interface has been integrated into cernml-coi; the LSA
  utilities have been integrated into
  [cernml-coi-utils](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/cernml-coi-utils/).
  Authors of optimization problems are encouraged to change their code
  accordingly.
- Add dependency on cernml-coi-utils v0.2.2. Having both the new utilities
  package and a cernml-coi version that still has its utilities will make
  transitioning to the new API easier.

### Bug fixes

- Fix crash when resetting after an aborted optimization due to unequal lengths
  in action/objective logs.

## v0.1.7

### Visible changes

- Change the way exceptions are logged. The exception message now always
  appears last, making it more visible in the log console.
- Increase the default value of BOBYQA's `rhobeg` parameter to 0.5 (was 0.1).
  Too many built-in environments failed to optimize speedily when the initial
  trust region was too small.
- When an environment is reset after numeric optimization, the associated actor
  values and loss are now appended to the respective history plots.

### Build changes

- Upgrade cern-sps-tune-env requirement to 0.3.0.
- Upgrade cern-sps-zs-alignment-env requirement to 0.3.0.

## v0.1.6

### Visible changes

- Only print message about skeleton points when configuring FunctionOptimizable
  problems.
- Replace load-file button for RL agent execution with a widget that displays
  the full path of the file.
- Support file paths in Configurable interface.
- Add context category filter menu to the LSA selector. This allows the user to
  display and choose non-operational contexts.
- Add `--version` command-line option.

### Bug fixes

- Add ISOLDE support.
- Avoid using JAPC selectors for machine A when instantiating an optimization
  problem for machine B.

## v0.1.5

### Visible changes

- Always attempt a location-based RBAC login at startup.
- Restyle built-in graphs of optimization/training progress.
- Make the accelerator-selection box a little less janky.
- Add Nelderâ€“Mead algorithm for single-objective optimization.
- Add Powell's method for single-objective optimization.

## v0.1.4

### Visible changes

- Much improved cancellation support. Compatible environments are now able to
  be stopped in the middle of an optimization step.

### Build changes

This upgrades cernml-coi to 0.7.0, which is a backwards-incompatible change.
Consequently, all dependent packages are upgraded as well:

- Upgrade cernml-coi requirement to 0.7.0.
- Upgrade cernml-coi-funcs requirement to 0.2.1.
- Upgrade cern-awake-env requirement to 0.15.0.
- Upgrade cern-leir-transfer-line-env requirement to 0.2.0.
- Upgrade cern-sps-tune-env requirement to 0.2.1.
- Upgrade cern-sps-zs-alignment-env requirement to 0.2.0.

## v0.1.3

### Visible changes

- Add [Singular Value Decomposition
  (SVD)](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/cernml-svd/) as an RL
  algorithm. It works best on linear problems that can be described by an
  invertible response matrix. Thanks to @ivojskov for the implementation!
- Update the simulated AWAKE electron beam steering problem. It now provides a
  new version v1, which does not include the first BPM (which cannot be
  influenced) nor the last kicker (whose effect cannot be observed). This
  removal makes the problem's response matrix invertible and thus compatible
  with SVD.

### Build changes

- Upgrade `cern-awake-env` requirement to 0.14.0.
- Upgrade `cern-coi` requirement to 0.6.2.
- Upgrade `cernml-coi` to 0.6.2. This enables `"cern.cancellable"`.

## v0.1.2

### Build changes

- Upgrade `cern-leir-transfer-line-env` requirement to 0.1.1.

## v0.1.1

### Visible changes

- Add CLI argument `--no-capture-stdout` for debugging purposes.
- Add CLI argument `--japc-no-set` for debugging purposes.
- Add a window title which shows the values of `--server` and `--japc-no-set`.

### Bug fixes

- Catch more plugin exceptions and log them instead of crashing.

## v0.1.0

### Visible changes

- Add initial, extremely fragile implementation of reinforcement learning (RL)
  via [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/).
- Add more built-in optimization problems:
    - [SPS ZS Alignment](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/envs/sps-zs-alignment),
    - [SPS Tune](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/envs/sps-tune/),
    - [LEIR Transfer Line](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/envs/leir-transfer-line).
- Add argument `--no-builtins` to start the app without loading the built-in
  optimization problems. In this case, all optimization problems must be
  provided as foreign imports. This mode is best used for debugging.
- Logging messages are no longer printed to standard output nor standard error.
  Instead, the app captures its out standard output/error and redirects them to
  its log console widget.

### Build changes

- Add dependency on Stable Baselines 3 and, transitively, on PyTorch.
- Complete rewrite of GUI code: drop Qt Designer and use hand-written PyQt5
  code instead.

### Bug fixes

- Integer spinboxes in configuration dialogs no longer clip their initial
  values into the range from 0 to 99 inclusive.
- Foreign imports now can import packages from inside zip and wheel files. To
  do so, treat the file as if it were a directory:
  `path/to/archive.zip/package::child_module`.

## v0.0.9

### Visible changes

- When a `coi.Problem` implements the `close()` method, the app now correctly
  calls it before switching to another problem. It also finalizes the `PyJapc`
  object before creating a new one. This behavior is currently not guaranteed
  when the app is *exiting*.
- Matplotlib-based plots (i.e. those created inside `coi.Problem.render()`) now
  are decorated with the navigation toolbar known from interactive Matplotlib
  usage. Each figure is given its own individual toolbar.

### Build changes

- Upgrade `cernml-coi` requirement to 0.6.
- Upgrade `cerml-coi-funcs` requirement to 0.1.1.

### Bug fixes

- Relax the requirement on Gym from `>=0.17, <0.18` to `>=0.17`.
- The new LSA selector introduced in [v0.0.7](#v007) no longer selected an LSA
  context by default. This would make it necessary to select a context even if
  the optimization problem does not require LSA or JAPC. The problem has been
  alleviated by always selecting the unmultiplexed context by default.

## v0.0.8

### Visible changes

- The configure dialog is now more lenient with unconventional config types.
  As the bare minimum, it shows a line-edit widget. Previously, a read-only
  label would be shown.

### Bug fixes

- When applying a configure dialog, check boxes that were never clicked would
  always register as True. This has been fixed.

## v0.0.7

### Visible changes

- Upgraded the LSA selector from a built-in version to the version provided by
  [AccWidgets](https://acc-py.web.cern.ch/gitlab/acc-co/accsoft/gui/accsoft-gui-pyqt-widgets/docs/stable/widgets/lsa_selector/index.html).
- Changed default LSA server from *next* to *gpn*.
- Made LSA server configurable on the command line: pass either `-sNAME` or
  `--lsa-server NAME`.

### Build changes

- Upgrade Python requirement to 3.7.
- Upgrade `accwidgets` requirement to 1.1.0 and only the widgets that are used.

## v0.0.6

### Visible changes

- The algorithms now log the optimization results. The level of the message
  depends on the result: successful optimization leaves an INFO entry, failed
  optimization either WARNING or ERROR.
- The initial step size of the BobyQA and COBYLA algorithms is now configurable
  in the GUI as "rhobeg".

## v0.0.5

### Visible changes

- Clicking the Reset button after running an optimization re-renders the
  optimization problem (i.e. calls `problem.render("matplotlib_figures")` if
  possible). This ensures that the user can see that the problem has indeed
  been reset.

## v0.0.4

### Bug fixes

- Unwrap the `Problem` when determining what kind of optimization job to start.
- Handle `render("matplotlib_figures")` returning a `Dict[str, Figure]`
  correctly.

## v0.0.3

### Visible changes

- The LSA context selector now remembers the context per accelerator and always
  selects a context if one is available.
- Add a logging console to the GUI.
- Add function optimization to the GUI.
- Add skeleton-point selection to the configure-environment dialog.
- Show the exception in a message box if environment initialization or
  configuration fail.
- Remove command-line options `--quiet` and `--verbose`.
- Show a please-wait dialog during environment initialization.

### Build changes

- Upgrade `cernml-coi` requirement to 0.4.
- Upgrade `accwidgets` requirement to 1.0.1 and all widgets.
- Add dependency on `cernml-coi-funcs`.
- Enable JPype import hooks while executing foreign imports.
- Update installation guide to include Acc-Py Base 2020.11.

### Bug fixes

- Log caught exceptions via `logging` module.

## v0.0.2

### Build changes

- Upgrade build setup to use `pyproject.toml`.
- Make `accwidgets` requirement stricter (0.4.X instead of >=0.4).
- Fix conflicting test dependencies (Require PyTest as modern as required by
  PyTest-Mock).

## v0.0.1

- Initial release.
